.B printf 
.SH SYNOPSIS
type code that we used here?
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a printf program created for Holberton School, which is a project-based alternative to college for the next generation of software engineers.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS 
.B These characters specify the type of conversion that can be applied.

   c - The int argument is converted to an unsigned char and the resulting character is displayed.

   s - This const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character types. The characters from the array are written but this doesn't contain the ending null byte ('\0').

   % - Writes '%' and no argument is converted. The complete conversion specifier is '%%'.
 
   d, i
     -  This converts int arguments to signed decimal notation.
